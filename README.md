### Python Object Types
    In python, data takes the form of objects, that are basically pieces of memory.
    Python can be decomposed into:
        1. Programs composed by modules
        2. Modules contein statements
        3. Statements contain expressions
        4. Expressios create and process objects

#### NUMBERS: INTEGERS, FLOATS, COMPLEX NUMBERS, FIXED-PRECISION DECIMALS, RATIONAL FRACTIONS
    Python support the usual mathematica operations (+; -; *; /; ** - exponentiation; // - integer division; % rest of division)

#### STRINGS
    Are used to record textual information a well as arbitrary colections of bytes (strings are sequeces) - Sequences maintain a left-to-right order among the items they contain
##### Sequence operations
    ```len```   -> returns the length os a sequence;
    Indexing expressions: the itens of a sequence may be accessed through "[index]", the counting os the indexes start at 0. Python also admites index backward (negative index);
    Slice expressions: [index1:index2:step]
    Concatenation using "+" and "*" signs 
##### Strings Immutability
